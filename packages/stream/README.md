# StreamDAOÂ´s - Stream Payment Protocol

Stream Payment is a token distribution platform powered by a streaming payments' protocol.

There are several ways to use **Stream Payment Protocol**:

- **(easiest) [streampayment.app](https://streampayment.app)** (React application that uses JS SDK directly)
- **[JS SDK](https://github.com/streamdao/payments-protocol-js-sdk)** to interact with the protocol => [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@streamdao/stream/v/2.0.0)
- **[Rust SDK](https://github.com/streamdao/stream-payment-protocol-rust-sdk)** to integrate within a Solana program => [Rust Crate](https://docs.rs/stream-payment-sdk/)

## JS SDK

This SDK allows you to `create`, `withdraw`, `cancel`, `topup` and `transfer` SPL token stream.

You can also `getOne` stream and `get` multiple streams.

---

### Installation

`npm i @streamdao/stream @solana/web3.js @project-serum/anchor`

> _Anchor is needed for the `Wallet` type. We plan on removing this dependency in upcoming releases._

`bn.js` library is used for handling big numbers.

```javascript
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { Wallet } from "@project-serum/anchor/src/provider";
import BN from "bn.js";
```

### Usage

#### Imports

Most common imports:

```javascript
import Stream, {
  Stream,
  CreateStreamParams,
  WithdrawStreamParams,
  TransferStreamParams,
  TopupStreamParams,
  CancelStreamParams,
  GetStreamParams,
  GetStreamsParams,
  StreamDirection,
  StreamType,
  Cluster,
  TransactionResponse,
  CreateStreamResponse,
} from "@streamdao/stream";
```

_Check the SDK for other types and utility functions._

#### Create stream

```javascript
const createStreamParams = {
  connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
  sender: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction, creating and sending the stream.
  recipient: "4ih00075bKjVg000000tLdk4w42NyG3Mv0000dc0M00", // Solana recipient address.
  mint: "DNw99999M7e24g99999999WJirKeZ5fQc6KY999999gK", // SPL Token mint.
  start: 1643363040, // Timestamp (in seconds) when the stream/token vesting starts.
  depositedAmount: new BN(1000000000000), // Deposited amount of tokens (using smallest denomination).
  period: 1, // Time step (period) in seconds per which the unlocking occurs.
  cliff: 1643363160, // Vesting contract "cliff" timestamp in seconds.
  cliffAmount: new BN(100000000000), // Amount (smallest denomination) unlocked at the "cliff" timestamp.
  amountPerPeriod: new BN(5000000000), // Release rate: how many tokens are unlocked per each period.
  name: "Transfer to Jane Doe.", // The stream name or subject.
  canTopup: false, // setting to FALSE will effectively create a vesting contract.
  cancelableBySender: true, // Whether or not sender can cancel the stream.
  cancelableByRecipient: false, // Whether or not recipient can cancel the stream.
  transferableBySender: true, // Whether or not sender can transfer the stream to the new recipient.
  transferableByRecipient: false, // Whether or not recipient can transfer the stream to the new recipient.
  automaticWithdrawal: true, // [WIP] Whether or not a 3rd party (e.g. cron job, "cranker") can initiate a token withdraw/transfer. Defaults to false.
  withdrawalFrequency: 10, // [WIP] Relevant when automatic withdrawal is enabled. If greater than 0 our withdrawor will take care of withdrawals. If equal to 0 our withdrawor will skip, but everyone else can initiate withdrawals.
  partner: "AAAAA075bKjVg000000tLdk4w42NyG3Mv0000dc0M00", // (optional) Partner's wallet address (string).
  cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // (optional) Cluster (default is Cluster.Mainnet).
};

try {
  const { tx, id } = await Stream.create(createStreamParams);
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

\_Disclaimer: Support for scheduled, automatic token withdrawals/transfers is under development and scheduled to launch in Q1. Once launched, it will be enabled retroactively for all streams that have `automaticWithdrawal` set to `true`.

Please note that transaction fees for the scheduled transfers are paid upfront by the stream creator (sender).\_

#### Withdraw from stream

```javascript
const withdrawStreamParams = {
  connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
  invoker: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction.
  id: "AAAAyotqTZZMAAAAmsD1JAgksT8NVAAAASfrGB5RAAAA", // Identifier of a stream to be withdrawn from.
  amount: new BN(100000000000), // Requested amount to withdraw. If stream is completed, the whole amount will be withdrawn.
  cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // Cluster (optional, default is Cluster.Mainnet).
};

try {
  const { tx } = await Stream.withdraw(withdrawStreamParams);
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

#### Topup stream

```javascript
const topupStreamParams = {
  connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
  invoker: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction.
  id: "AAAAyotqTZZMAAAAmsD1JAgksT8NVAAAASfrGB5RAAAA", // Identifier of a stream to be topped up.
  amount: new BN(100000000000), // Specified amount to topup (increases deposited amount).
  cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // Cluster (optional, default is Cluster.Mainnet).
};

try {
  const { tx } = await Stream.topup(topupStreamParams);
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

#### Transfer stream to another recipient

```javascript
const data = {
  connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
  invoker: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction.
  id: "AAAAyotqTZZMAAAAmsD1JAgksT8NVAAAASfrGB5RAAAA",
  recipientId: "99h00075bKjVg000000tLdk4w42NyG3Mv0000dc0M99", // Identifier of a stream to be transferred.
  cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // Cluster (optional, default is Cluster.Mainnet).
};

try {
  const { tx } = await Stream.transfer(data);
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

#### Cancel stream

```javascript
const cancelStreamParams = {
  connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
  invoker: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction.
  id: "AAAAyotqTZZMAAAAmsD1JAgksT8NVAAAASfrGB5RAAAA", // Identifier of a stream to be canceled.
  cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // Cluster (optional, default is Cluster.Mainnet).
};

try {
  const { tx } = await Stream.cancel(cancelStreamParams);
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

#### Get one stream by its ID

```javascript
try {
  const stream = await Stream.getOne({
    connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
    id: "AAAAyotqTZZMAAAAmsD1JAgksT8NVAAAASfrGB5RAAAA", // Identifier of a stream that is fetched.
  });
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

#### Get multiple streams for a specific wallet address

```javascript
try {
  const streams = Stream.get({
    connection: connection, // Connection to the cluster.
    wallet: wallet, // Wallet signing the transaction.
    type: StreamType.All, // (optional) Type, default is StreamType.All
    direction: StreamDirection.All, // (optional) Direction, default is StreamDirection.All)
    cluster: Cluster.Mainnet, // (optional) Cluster, default is Cluster.Mainnet).
  });
} catch (exception) {
  // handle exception
}
```

**All BN amounts are denominated in their smallest units.**

E.g, if the amount is 1 SOL than this amount in lamports is `1000 \* 10^9 = 1_000_000_000.`

And `new BN(1_000_000_000)` is used.

Use `getBN` and `getNumberFromBN` utility functions for conversions between `BN` and `Number` types.
